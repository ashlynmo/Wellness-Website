# Wellness-Website - Front-End / UX Project
Static archive of a WordPress site I designed, customized, and launched for a spiritual wellness brand. Built the front end with Elementor, Canva-created assets and custom CSS/HTML to extend styling beyond default theme limitations.

**Live demo:** <a href="http://sageandmoon.netlify.app/sageandmoon.co/" target="_blank">View Site Here</a>

### Key highlights: 
- **Cohesive dark theme:** global black backgrounds with white/grey accents for readability
- **Typography system:** multiple custom fonts applied across body, headings, navigation, and archive pages
- **Navigation UX:** styled responsive menus, hover states, and mobile sub-menu interactions
- **Featured carousel:** custom heights, image sizing, and layout adjustments for a polished hero section
- **User experience:** designed clear hierarchy (H1â€“H3 sizing, spacing, page titles) to guide visitors
- **Custom components:** styled search form, disclaimer text, and widget areas for visual consistency
